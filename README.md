# Face Mask Detection Project

## Overview

This project is a real-time face mask detection system that uses deep learning models to accurately detect whether individuals in images and videos are wearing masks. The system leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify faces into mask and no-mask categories. The primary goal of this project is to develop a robust and efficient system for real-time mask detection to aid in public health measures.

## Technologies Used

- **OpenCV**: For image processing and face detection.
- **Keras**: For building and training deep learning models.
- **TensorFlow**: As the backend for Keras to leverage its powerful deep learning capabilities.
- **Imutils**: For easy image processing and video stream handling.
